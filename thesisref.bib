abstract = {Modelling Indian languages is difficult as the number of word forms they present is high. In such cases, prior work has proposed using subwords instead of words as the basic units to model the language. This provides the potential to cover more word forms. Additionally, previous work revealed that all Indian languages have several phonetic similarities. Consequently, multilingual acoustic models have been proposed to counter the data scarcity issue most Indian language datasets have. However, these models use monolingual language models (LM). They do not exploit the common basic tokens that certain Indian languages have. This motivated us to implement a bilingual subword-based Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system for Hindi and Marathi. Further, we try a combination of word-based monolingual LM with bilingual acoustic model to examine the reason for degradation in word-based multilingual ASRs. Our experiments show that multilingual subword-based ASR models outperform their word-based counterparts by upto 9.77% and 26.35% relative Character Error Rate (CER) in the case of Hindi and Marathi respectively.},

	abstract     = {Grapheme-to-Phoneme (G2P) has many applications in NLP and speech fields. Most existing work focuses heavily on languages with abundant training datasets, which limits the scope of target languages to less than 100 languages. This work attempts to apply zero-shot learning to approximate G2P models for all low-resource and endangered languages in Glottolog (about 8k languages). For any unseen target language, we first build the phylogenetic tree (i.e. language family tree) to identify top-$k$ nearest languages for which we have training sets. Then we run models of those languages to obtain a hypothesis set, which we combine into a confusion network to propose a most likely hypothesis as an approximation to the target language. We test our approach on over 600 unseen languages and demonstrate it significantly outperforms baselines.}

	abstract     = {The two key components of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems are language modeling and acoustic modeling. The language model generates a lexicon, which is a pronunciation dictionary. A lexicon can be created using a variety of approaches. For low-resource languages, rule-based methods are typically employed to build the lexicon. However, because the corpus is often tiny, this methodology does not account for all possible pronunciation variances. As a result, low-resource languages like Malayalam require a method for developing a comprehensive lexicon as the corpus grows. In this work, we explored deep learning based encoder-decoder models for grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion in Malayalam. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) encoder models with varying embedding dimensions were used to create the encoder model. The performance of the deep learning models used for G2P conversion was measured using the Word Error Rate (WER) and Phoneme Error Rate (PER). With 1024 embedding dimensions, the encoder using the BiLSTM model had the maximum accuracy of 98.04{\%} and the lowest PER of 2.57{\%} at the phoneme level, and the highest accuracy of 90.58{\%} and the lowest WER of 9.42{\%} at the word level.}

The author used previously developed rules and independently developed the grapheme-to-phoneme conversion algorithm.The algorithm has been implemented as a software application called TransFon, which allows the user to convert any text in Polish orthography to corresponding strings of phonemes, in phonemic transcription. Using TransFon, a phonemic Polish language corpus was created out of an orthographic corpus. The phonemic language corpusallows statistical analysis of the Polish language, as well as the development of phoneme- and word-based language models for automatic speech recognition using statistical methods. The developed phonemic language corpus opens up further opportunities for research to improve automatic speech recognition in Polish. The development of statistical methods for speech recognition and language modelling requires access to large language corpora, including phonemic corpora. The method presented here enables the creation of such corpora.}

	abstract     = {We describe a novel way to implement subword language models in speech recognition systems based on weighted finite state transducers, hidden Markov models, and deep neural networks. The acoustic models are built on graphemes in a way that no pronunciation dictionaries are needed, and they can be used together with any type of subword language model, including character models. The advantages of short subword units are good lexical coverage, reduced data sparsity, and avoiding vocabulary mismatches in adaptation. Moreover, constructing neural network language models (NNLMs) is more practical, because the input and output layers are small. We also propose methods for combining the benefits of different types of language model units by reconstructing and combining the recognition lattices. We present an extensive evaluation of various subword units on speech datasets of four languages: Finnish, Swedish, Arabic, and English. The results show that the benefits of short subwords are even more consistent with NNLMs than with traditional n-gram language models. Combination across different acoustic models and language models with various units improve the results further. For all the four datasets we obtain the best results published so far. Our approach performs well even for English, where the phoneme-based acoustic models and word-based language models typically dominate: The phoneme-based baseline performance can be reached and improved by 4\% using graphemes only when several grapheme-based models are combined. Furthermore, combining both grapheme and phoneme models yields the state-of-the-art error rate of 15.9\% for the MGB 2018 dev17b test. For all four languages we also show that the language models perform reasonably well when only limited training data is available.}

We find that several morphological measures are significantly associated with higher surprisal when LSTM models are trained with BPE-segmented data. We also investigate linguistically motivated subword segmentation strategies like Morfessor and Finite-State Transducers (FSTs) and find that these segmentation strategies yield better performance and reduce the impact of a language's morphology on language modeling.}}

Malayalam is a Dravidian language spoken in India, predominantly in the state of Kerala with about 38 million native speakers. Malayalam words undergo inflections, derivations and compounding leading to an infinitely extending lexicon. In this work, morphological complexity of Malayalam is quantitatively analyzed on a text corpus containing 8 million words. The analysis is based on the parameters type-token growth rate (TTGR), type-token ratio (TTR) and moving average type-token ratio (MATTR). The values of the parameters obtained in the current study is compared to that of the values of other morphologically complex languages.},

Text-to-speech systems for such languages will thus be extremely beneficial for wide-spread content creation and accessibility. Despite this, the current TTS systems for even the most popular Indian languages fall short of the contemporary state-of-the-art systems for English, Chinese, etc. We believe that one of the major reasons for this is the lack of large, publicly available text-to-speech corpora in these languages that are suitable for training neural text-to-speech systems. To mitigate this, we release a 24 hour text-to-speech corpus for 3 major Indian languages namely Hindi, Malayalam and Bengali. In this work, we also train a state-of-the-art TTS system for each of these languages and report their performances. The collected corpus, code, and trained models are made publicly available.},

In this paper, we compare a fully convolutional approach for acoustic modelling in ASR with a variety of established acoustic modeling approaches. We evaluate our method on Seneca, a low-resource endangered language spoken in North America. Our method yields word error rates up to 40{\%} lower than those reported using both standard GMM-HMM approaches and established deep neural methods, with a substantial reduction in training time. These results show particular promise for languages like Seneca that are both endangered and lack extensive documentation.},

	abstract     = {Serbian is in a group of highly inflective and morphologically rich languages that use a lot of different word suffixes to express different grammatical, syntactic, or semantic features. This kind of behaviour usually produces a lot of recognition errors, especially in large vocabulary systems--even when, due to good acoustical matching, the correct lemma is predicted by the automatic speech recognition system, often a wrong word ending occurs, which is nevertheless counted as an error. This effect is larger for contexts not present in the language model training corpus. In this manuscript, an approach which takes into account different morphological categories of words for language modeling is examined, and the benefits in terms of word error rates and perplexities are presented. These categories include word type, word case, grammatical number, and gender, and they were all assigned to words in the system vocabulary, where applicable. These additional word features helped to produce significant improvements in relation to the baseline system, both for n-gram-based and neural network-based language models. The proposed system can help overcome a lot of tedious errors in a large vocabulary system, for example, for dictation, both for Serbian and for other languages with similar characteristics.},

In prior work (Cotterell et al., 2018) we attempted to address this question for language modeling, and observed that recurrent neural network language models do not perform equally well over all the high-resource European languages found in the Europarl corpus. We speculated that inflectional morphology may be the primary culprit for the discrepancy. In this paper, we extend these earlier experiments to cover 69 languages from 13 language families using a multilingual Bible corpus. Methodologically, we introduce a new paired-sample multiplicative mixed-effects model to obtain language difficulty coefficients from at-least-pairwise parallel corpora. In other words, the model is aware of inter-sentence variation and can handle missing data. Exploiting this model, we show that {``}translationese{''} is not any easier to model than natively written language in a fair comparison. Trying to answer the question of what features difficult languages have in common, we try and fail to reproduce our earlier (Cotterell et al., 2018) observation about morphological complexity and instead reveal far simpler statistics of the data that seem to drive complexity in a much larger sample.}

These are languages that belong to different linguistic families, the latter are low-resourced. We take into account two quantitative criteria, on one hand the distribution of types over tokens in a corpus, on the other, perplexity and entropy as indicators of word structure predictability. We show that a language can be complex in terms of how many different morphological word forms can produce, however, it may be less complex in terms of predictability of its internal structure of words.}

While sentences are usually converted into unique subword sequences, subword segmentation is potentially ambiguous and multiple segmentations are possible even with the same vocabulary. The question addressed in this paper is whether it is possible to harness the segmentation ambiguity as a noise to improve the robustness of NMT. We present a simple regularization method, subword regularization, which trains the model with multiple subword segmentations probabilistically sampled during training. In addition, for better subword sampling, we propose a new subword segmentation algorithm based on a unigram language model. We experiment with multiple corpora and report consistent improvements especially on low resource and out-of-domain settings.}

TTS frontends typically include text processing, lexical lookup and Grapheme-to-Phoneme (g2p) conversion stages. This paper describes the design and implementation of the Indic frontend, which provides explicit support for many major Indian languages, along with a unified framework with easy extensibility for other Indian languages. The Indic frontend handles many phenomena common to Indian languages such as schwa deletion, contextual nasalization, and voicing. It also handles multi-script synthesis between various Indian-language scripts and English. We describe experiments comparing the quality of TTS systems built using the Indic frontend to grapheme-based systems. While this frontend was designed keeping TTS in mind, it can also be used as a general g2p system for Automatic Speech Recognition.}

Word-based language models cannot transfer knowledge from common word forms to rarer variant forms. Learning a continuous vector representation of each morpheme allows a compositional model to represent a word as the sum of its constituent morphemes' vectors. Rare and unknown words containing common morphemes can thus be represented with greater fidelity despite their sparsity. Our novel neural network language model integrates this additive morphological representation into a long short-term memory architecture, improving Russian speech recognition word error rates by 0.9 absolute, 4.4\% relative, compared to a robust n–gram baseline model.},

Phoneme recognition is the first step performed by automatic speech recognition system. The state-of-the-art recognizers use mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) features derived through short time analysis, for which the recognition accuracy is limited. Instead of this, here broad phoneme classification is achieved using features derived directly from the speech at the signal level itself. Broad phoneme classes include vowels, nasals, fricatives, stops, approximants and silence. The features identified useful for broad phoneme classification are voiced/unvoiced decision, zero crossing rate (ZCR), short time energy, most dominant frequency, energy in most dominant frequency, spectral flatness measure and first three formants. Features derived from short time frames of training speech are used to train a multilayer feedforward neural network based classifier with manually marked class label as output and classification accuracy is then tested. Later this broad phoneme classifier is used for broad syllable structure prediction which is useful for applications such as automatic speech recognition and automatic language identification.},

We then describe the development of a smartphone-based data collection tool, Woefzela, which is designed to function in a developing world context. Specifically, this tool is designed to function without any Internet connectivity, while remaining portable and allowing for the collection of multiple sessions in parallel; it also simplifies the data collection process by providing process support to various role players during the data collection process, and performs on-device quality control in order to maximise the use of recording opportunities.},

In order to incorporate the prosodic information into baseline phonetic engine a new algorithm for automatic labeling of prosody is proposed.

abstract = {This paper describes the implementation of a dictation system for Malayalam office documents in OpenOffice Writer. Dictation system is built using state-of-the-art large vocabulary continuous speech recognition system for the Malayalam language. This system supports a vocabulary of 5000 most commonly used office domain words and is employed with a vocabulary updating facility to handle out-of-vocabulary words. The system is based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM), trained with huge (25 hours) amount of data. The training data is collected in room environment, ensuring the speaker variance and the phonetic richness. A hybrid model which integrates the rule based method with statistical method is used to handle the pronunciation variations for the creation of the pronunciation dictionary. The system is first of its kind which simplifies the tedious task of typing in Malayalam. Apart from dictating office documents with 75 ±5 % accuracy, the system is equipped with a facility of suggestion generation by which the user will be provided with alternate words for mis-recognized words. The system also supports some basic voice command operations for file operations like open, save, close etc. This system has an option to adapt to the user's voice which will improve the recognition accuracy by 2-5%. The system is successfully implemented in OpenOffice Writer and tested.},

In this work, the HMM based phoneme models use the emission probabilities estimated from the posterior probabilities obtained through Multi Layer Perceptrons. We evaluated the performance of our proposed system on a small vocabulary, speaker independent continuous Malayalam speech corpus and our system has produced a promising result of 86.67 \% word and 66.67\% sentence recognition rates. This is the first reported result for a Malayalam speaker independent continuous speech recognizer based on an HMM/ANN hybrid framework.},

In the context of Indian languages, systematic analysis of various speech features and classification models in view of automatic language identification has not performed, because of the lack of proper speech corpus covering majority of the Indian languages. With this motivation, we have initiated the task of developing multilingual speech corpus in Indian languages. In this paper spectral features are explored for investigating the presence of language specific information. Melfrequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and linear predictive cepstral coefficients (LPCCs) are used for representing the spectral information. Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are developed to capture the language specific information present in spectral features. The performance of language identification system is analyzed in view of speaker dependent and independent cases. The recognition performance is observed to be 96\% and 45\% respectively, for speaker dependent and independent environments.},

Artificial Neural Network technique (ANN) is used for classification and recognition purpose. We have used five Malayalam (one of the South Indian languages) words for the experiment. One hundred and sixty samples are collected, categorized labeled and stored in a database. The feature vector is produced for all words and formed a training set for classification and recognition purpose. A sequence of decomposition levels are carried out to achieve a good feature vector. A feature vector of element size twelve is collected for all words at the eighth level of decomposition. A graph is also prepared for the comparison of the signal at each decomposition level. From that graph we can understand the physical changes that are occurred during the decomposition. By using this method we have achieved a recognition rate of 89\%.},

The system produces at its output, a parallel representation of the pronunciation and the morphological analysis of the word form so that further disambiguation processes can be used to disambiguate pronunciation. The pronunciation representation is based on the SAMPA standard and also encodes the position of the primary stress. The computation of the position of the primary stress depends on an interplay of any exceptional stress in root words and stress properties of certain morphemes, and requires that a full morphological analysis be done. The system has been implemented using XRCE Finite State Toolkit.},

%%% Notes! This is because the atsign-INBOOK citation type specifies EITHER
%%% editor or author, but not both. In my experiments with the harvard/dcu
%%% bibtex style (and presumably this applies to other styles too), bibtex
%%% ignores the editor information if author information exists in an
%%% atsign-INBOOK entry. atsign-INCOLLECTION is far more commonly used in my references,
%%% and in the absence of an editor I believe most bibtex styles will just
%%% ommit the editor from the reference - the chapter information will not
%%% end up in the in-text citation as you suggest it should be but at least
%%% there is a place to put the editor if necessary.



% was 'Inbook' -- changed to incollection - (editor is different to author) - need to tell Asad to codify as such.

	abstract     = {We survey the use of weighted finite-state transducers (WFSTs) in speech recognition. We show that WFSTs provide a common and natural representation for hidden Markov models (HMMs), context-dependency, pronunciation dictionaries, grammars, and alternative recognition outputs. Furthermore, general transducer operations combine these representations flexibly and efficiently. Weighted determinization and minimization algorithms optimize their time and space requirements, and a weight pushing algorithm distributes the weights along the paths of a weighted transducer optimally for speech recognition. As an example, we describe a North American Business News (NAB) recognition system built using these techniques that combines the HMMs, full cross-word triphones, a lexicon of 40 000 words, and a large trigram grammar into a single weighted transducer that is only somewhat larger than the trigram word grammar and that runs NAB in real-time on a very simple decoder. In another example, we show that the same techniques can be used to optimize lattices for second-pass recognition. In a third example, we show how general automata operations can be used to assemble lattices from different recognizers to improve recognition performance.}

	abstract     = {This dissertation introduces a new analysis/synthesis method. It is designed to obtain musically useful intermediate representations for sound transformations. The method{\textquoteright}s underlying model assumes that a sound is composed of a deterministic component plus a stochastic one. The deterministic component is represented by a series of sinusoids that are described by amplitude and frequency functions. The stochastic component is represented by a series of magnitude-spectrum envelopes that function as a time-varying filter excited by white noise. Together these representations make it possible for a synthesized sound to attain all the perceptual characteristics of the original sound. At the same time the representation is easily modified to create a wide variety of new sounds. This analysis/synthesis technique is based on the short-time Fourier transform (STFT). From the set of spectra returned by the STFT, the relevant peaks of each spectrum are detected and used as breakpoints in a set of frequency trajectories. The deterministic signal is obtained by synthesizing a sinusoid from each trajectory. Then, in order to obtain the stochastic component, a set of spectra of the deterministic component is computed, and these spectra are subtracted from the spectra of the original sound. The resulting spectral residuals are approximated by a series of envelopes, from which the stochastic signal is generated by performing an inverse-STFT. The result is a method that is appropriate for the manipulation of sounds. The intermediate representation is very flexible and musically useful in that it offers unlimited possibilities for transformation.}

	abstract     = {Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has received greater level of acceptance as it creates speech recognition by the human machine interface. This paper focuses on developing a syllable based speech recognition system for Malayalam language. The proposed system consists of three different phases such as preprocessing, segmentation and classification. The preprocessing is performed for noise reduction, DC component removal, pre-emphasis and framing. The segmentation process implemented using Syllable Segmentation Algorithm segments the word utterances into syllables, that are inturn fed into the system for feature extraction. In the feature extraction step, we have proposed a novel approach by adding energy and zero crossing, along with MFCC features. The classification is done using Artificial Neural Network and is also compared with HMM classifier. Experiments are carried out with real-time utterances of 100 words, and obtained 96.4 \% accuracy in ANN, which outperformed HMM.},
